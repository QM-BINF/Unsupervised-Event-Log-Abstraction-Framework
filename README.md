Unsupervised-ELA-Framework
============================

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code, simulation models, and event logs for the **Unsupervised Event Log Abstraction** project as submitted to Information Systems (version 2023/11/10). The repository contains python, R, and Java code.

This project is licensed under the MIT License: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/.

## Usage

In order to start working with this repository, it is advised to clone it to your machine:

    git clone https://github.com/gregvanhoudt/Unsupervised-ELA-Framework.git

Once the repository is cloned, you can navigate to the root directory of the project and install the required dependencies for this project. Dependencies required for sub-applications in this repository are detailed below.

### Applications

The root folder of the repository contains a number of `app_` python files.

- `App_Abstraction.py`

    The application to perform **session-based** abstraction. For this application to run successfully, due to backwards compatibility, `PM4py` version 2.2.2 and `graphviz` version 0.15.0 are required.

- `App_BPSimulation.py`

    The application to generate business processes and their simulation models.

- `App_Evaluation.py`

    After obtaining all low-level and high-level event logs, this application computes relevant evaluation metrics. To be more specific, this application computes the replay-based fitness (with also a line included for alignment-based fitness) and precision values. The simplicity metric is also included.

- `App_EventLogTranslation.py`

    This application transforms the L-Sim XML output files towards event logs following the .XES standard: https://xes-standard.org/.

- `App_Petri_size_Counter.py`

    This application computes for a given abstraction level the size of the Petri nets. The size is important for evaluation purposes, as we are interested in how much smaller the higher-level event logs have become.

- `App_Petri_to_BPMN.py`

    This application transforms Petri nets for a given abstraction level into BPMN models.

To conclude, `EventLogs.csv` is included to provide a list of all event logs to iterate over where needed.


### src - Source Files

This directory contains all source files the applications above depend upon. They are divided into, as with the applications, Abstraction, Evaluation, and Simulation.

Additionally, to perform the LPM-based abstraction in a batch approach, a modification had to be made to the ProM (https://promtools.org/) installation. This modification is stored in `ProM_Installation`. The script `VSC-Experiment-LPM.txt` contains the Java code used to instruct the CLI-instance of ProM to mine LPM's and abstract an event log. The script is written to elevate **one** event log.

Finally, the subdirectory `src` also contains an R script named `UnderstandBPMN.R` containing the code to compute the relevant complexity metrics, forming the proxy with comprehensibility.


### BPSim - Simulation Models

The simulation models used in the experiment are generated by running `App_BPSimulation.py`. Executing this application generates new business simulation models and stores the related process trees and BPMN process models. The main parameters are `tree_size` and `n`, with which you can determine the size of each generated business process and the number of processes to generate in total. In case you find the need to alter the distributions further used in the simulation model, you can adapt the `params` dictionary accordingly.

The transformation of this simulation model to an event log, is done by the L-Sim simulator. More information at https://www.lanner.com/en-gb/technology/l-sim-bpmn-simulation-engine.html.

### Event Logs

Because there is no open access to the L-Sim simulator, the outcome of business process simulation is shared in this repository. All event logs are located in the Logs/.gz subfolder in a compressed format. Uncompressing the event logs is not necessary to execute the experimental framework.
